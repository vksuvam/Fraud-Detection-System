# Fraud-Detection-System


 * Problem Statement:
 The company aims to analyze and enhance its current fraud detection mechanisms using
 generative AI. The goal is to accurately identify and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time,
 adapting quickly to emerging fraud patterns while minimizing false positives that could
 inconvenience legitimate users. Key areas of concern include:

   * Data Collection and Preprocessing: Evaluating the quality and diversity of transaction
 data used for training the fraud detection models. Identifying potential gaps or biases in
 the data that could affect the accuracy of fraud detection.
   * Anomaly Detection and Pattern Recognition: Enhancing the modelâ€™s ability to detect
 anomalies and recognize complex fraud patterns in real-time. Developing techniques to
 improve the sensitivity and specificity of fraud detection algorithms.
   * User Privacy and Data Security: Ensuring that the use of generative AI adheres to
 strict user privacy and data security standards. Balancing the need for fraud detection
 with user privacy concerns.

# Overview

* Data Loading and Encryption:
  * Load the transaction data from a CSV file.
  * To ensure data privacy, encrypt sensitive data.

* Data Anonymization and Differential Privacy:
  * Remove personally identifiable information (PII) by dropping the user_id column.
  * For numerical features (like transaction amount), add some "fuzziness" to enhance privacy (differential privacy).

* Data Preprocessing:
  * Encode categorical features into a format a machine can understand using one-hot encoding.
  * Standardize numerical features.
  * Perform feature engineering to extract additional features like transaction hour and day.

* Data Splitting:
  * Split the data into training and testing sets.

* Anomaly Detection:
  * Use Isolation Forest to detect anomalies in the transaction data.

* Pattern Recognition:
  * Train a neural network using Keras to recognize fraud patterns in the data.

* Model Evaluation:
  * Evaluate the model's performance on the test set and generate classification reports and confusion matrices.
